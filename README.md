# The Decentralized Cryptocurrency Exchange (dEx)

Let us ask ourselves one fundamental question: what is a stock exchange? Well, it is an online marketplace where one can exchange company stocks for fiat currency, like the USD. The entire process is centralized, i.e., a stock broker sits between you and the market and allows / aids you in making your trades.

With this background of the online financial markets in mind, let us try understanding what we have built: a dEx.

## dEx: What is It?

dEx literally stands for "Decentralized Exchange." It is an online exchange which is not centrally controlled by any brokerage firms, i.e., every trade one makes gets processed by the smart contracts deployed to the blockchain networks, and no human interaction takes place during the trade, ever. Such an automated process, controlled solely by computer code, is much more efficient, trustworthy and transparent. This is all there is to a decentralized exchange at a very fundamental level. Yes, it is that simple.

Given that this dEx has been built for cryptocurrency trading, therefore, one can only trade digital cryptocurrencies on such an exchange, not the stocks. For the latter, we have stock exchanges as described above in detail.

## Part-01: Creating a New Cryptocurrency

An exchange can only work if there are some currencies listed to be exchanged on it in the first place. That's why we created a smart contract to build an ERC-20 fungible token of our own. This token is essentially our own cryptocurrency that complies with the coding standards of the Ethereum blockchain. 

We used the best coding practices and complied with the industry standards. Also, we rigorously tested all the token functionality using Chai, Hardhat and JavaScript on our local single-node blockchain.
